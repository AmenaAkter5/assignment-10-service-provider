                    <p>I am the student of University of Dhaka. Though I am studying BBA but my dream to become a programmer and set my career in this field. I want to build a valuable job experience in this field. So, I enrolled the Jhankar Mahbub's Full Web development Course as a a first step to fulfill my dream. Then I will enroll in <b>CSE Fundamentals With Phitron</b> course as my next step to go ahead to my dream.</p>
                    <p>To achieve my goal I will try my best. It will be the non compromisable task for me. Everyday I will provide my effort to reach out my goal. To achieve something I need to keep patience, be persistent. I will keep my persistency to touch my dream.</p>
